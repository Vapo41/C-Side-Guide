### Room 3 Multiboost

To do the multiboost here, you must neutral jump off the block, then on the **next frame** input a left climbjump. To do so, I would highly recommend binding a left climbjump button, as doing this manually is incredibly difficult. Note that you can hold the first jump input to make this easier to input. After performing the multiboost, you need to switch to holding right fairly quickly, to ensure you actually get the speed from it in the direction you want.

For practicing this trick, I would highly recommend downloading the [Input History](https://gamebanana.com/mods/34273) mod: this lets you easily see when you failed to do the inputs frame consecutively. Note that sometimes you can input a neutral -> left climbjump frame consecutively and not get the boost: I'm not too sure why this happens and it's unfortunate, all you can really do is try again.

With the input display mod above, I would recommend practicing the inputs in isolation first, and trying a few different options to see what lets you perform it the most consistently. Personally, even as a controller player, I found it much easier to get frame consecutive inputs on keyboard than with two controller buttons next to each other. This may be different for some people depending on your hardware and personal preferences, so see what works best for you.
