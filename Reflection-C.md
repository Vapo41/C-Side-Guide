### Room 1 Demo

The main setup here is holding fastfall+jump out of the hyper, which gives you a consistent 1 frame window to demo through the spinners. I would recommend extending the hyper as much as possible, both to ensure you get a frame for the demo and a better bumper cycle afterwards. The timesave on this demo can vary due to how awkward this room is to optimise, but in general I would recommend looking into it if you plan on pushing for a 33/34 6C roughly.

Note that if you play this room on entry cycle, jumping on the last possible frame for the extended hyper lets you buffer another demo, saving around 0.3. Due to the extra reset time and difficulty I probably wouldn't recommend this unless you're going for WR, but it felt worth noting.

### Feather Demo

To "set this up", do a transition hyper, jump rather late, and then hold fastfall+jump. This gives you a 2 frame window to right dash and hold downleft into the feather to get the correct height. The 2 frames for this are roughly the 2nd last and 3rd last frame before you'd hit the spinners and die.
\
Note that even with the correct y-value for the demo, you are not always guaranteed a frame for the demo, the best you can do is just hope and pray. As a result this strat is one of the worst in the game, and I'd only recommend doing it if you really want your 6C to be 2 seconds faster and are willing to put in the resets for it. Good luck :)

### Room 2 Walljump Skips

After the feather demo, there are 2 fairly precise walljump skips you can do. The timesave and difficulty can vary a lot depending on your input methods, how many you do (doing the first walljump skip can make the second one much harder), and how well you can optimise the normal feather movement, so I'd recommend timing them for yourself and seeing how many you can put up with.

The first walljump skip is fairly simple in execution but very tight and feel based: the best cue I have is start holding right while Madeline's feet roughly start to align with the spinner here. 

The second walljump skip mainly just comes down to greeding your feather movement as much as possible. On keyboard it can be helpful to do an upleft featherboost here to make this more manageable.

### Room 3 Kevin Ultra

This strat has a lot to it, so let's try and break it down. First, the movement to bring the kevin up: the version in this gif what I would recommend, however some people prefer an alternative (and slightly faster) setup which you can find [here](https://youtu.be/uW_ABhRCNXw?t=20).

The next thing worth noting is the height of the kevin. This is the rough cue I use, where the top of the kevin is just a bit below the spinners. The height here is somewhat lenient: you can definitely go a few pixels above this, and perhaps one or two pixels below as well. 
\

From here, wait until the kevin collides with the wall, and input an instant hyper -> ultra.

The final part is dealing with this bumper at the end, for which you have a few options. The main one I would recommend is going under the bumper: if you manage your jump height well this gives you a few frames to updash and drift left into the bumper (and even a frame where you can updash directly into the bumper and save a few tenths, though this is very risky and right at the end of a brutal level).

This gif highlights two alternative options for dealing with the bumper, which some people may find easier. All of these are a fairly similar speed, so try everything and see what you prefer.
