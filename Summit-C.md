### Room 1 Orbskip

There are several ways you can get this, but the main things to focus on to maximise consistency are:

- do a cornercorrected buffered updemo wallbounce, and hold jump until you reach the dash crystal
- tap right
- buffer downdash -> left demo

From which you have 1 frame to input jump, and get a reverse demohyper. From there, the jump hold length is fairly feel based and precise to navigate through the spinners, but can be consistent with practice. Overall this is pretty difficult but saves around a second, so I'd recommend looking into it if you plan on pushing for around a 42/43 7c time.

### Room 2 Demo

This one is fairly self explanatory, but felt worth documenting as it saves around 2 seconds, making it potentially viable fullgame with pause buffering. The main thing to keep in mind for doing this demo unpaused is do a regular (non-demo) upright into the spring, then demo roughly around here.

Note that this setup isn't always guaranteed to give you a frame if you hit the spring too high, but you generally get one most of the time. If you would like to pause buffer this fullgame (finish this later)

### Room 3 Demo 1

The demo shown above is the most lenient version if you just want to do one demo here. The main thing it comes down to is hitting the spring fairly high up, from which you should have a few frames to input the demo. Due to the variance of the spring hit it's hard to give a precise cue beyond just "when it looks like Madeline is at the right height", but as far as demos go this is one of the more manageable ones to get a feel for.

This version is notably harder, but quite a bit faster overall. The first dmeo is set up by holding fastfall+jump from the wavedash beforehand, which gives you a consistent 1 frame window for the demo. From there, if you quickly do an upright into the spring, you have a 1 frame window to perform the second demo. (citation needed)
