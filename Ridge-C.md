The first thing worth noting here is the jump directly from the autoscroller block to the left wall. This is normally a 1 frame window, but can be made a 2 frame window if you hold left+grab, so I would highly recommend doing that for consistency. The image above and the frame after are when you can perform this jump.

Once you are on the wall, the spike super is mainly a matter of making sure you buffer the jump on the super, to avoid dying to the spikes. This saves around 0.2 over doing an upright -> walljump on the right side of the block, so I would recommend it if you plan on grinding the level to roughly a 26 or better.
