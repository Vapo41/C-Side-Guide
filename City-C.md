### Room 2 Boost

This is a fairly complicated strat with a lot of tight inputs, and will take a fair bit of practice to get to the point of being even IL viable, but saves around 2 seconds when done correctly, making it very significant if you plan on pushing for a top 1C time. To try and break it down:

First, you want to set up the correct height. This is done by climbing to the top of this zipper, then doing an updemo and holding left to get onto the next zipper. This consistently puts you high enough on the next zipper block to perform the next part.

From here, you have 1 frame to perform an updemo -> wallbounce -> cornerboost. Due to the speed and general precision it is hard to develop a cue for this, but the image shown above is the correct frame. If you get a wallbounce but not much speed, it's likely you failed to input the cornerboost.

The downright afterwards is slightly more lenient, but still fairly tight. You want to downright after Madeline clears the spike pit below her: from my experience the timing for this is generally a bit earlier than you'd think, but it can be different for everyone.

For the jump in the next room, you want to make sure you are still holding down to crouch, and go for as much coyote as you can on the jump here. The length of the jump has to be fairly short to avoid hitting the spiked pillar in the middle of the room, but if you tap as quickly as possible you may not make it to the end, so be wary of that.

If all this is done correctly, you should be able to right dash to the final zipper block in room 2, effectively skipping all of it. Occasionally if your jump tap is too short you may have to upright, which still works but loses around 0.1-0.2.
